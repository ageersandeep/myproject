            a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in
            the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor.
            GitHub Copilot is powered by a generative AI model developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

            GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the
            quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that
            language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's
            best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or
            less robust suggestions.
